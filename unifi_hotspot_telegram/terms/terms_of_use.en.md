# 1. Permission to Use Wireless Internet Access

The operator provides wireless internet access (WLAN). During the user's stay, they are offered the opportunity to use this WLAN internet access. The user is not authorized to grant third parties access to this WLAN. The operator is not able, nor obligated within the scope of this shared use by the user, to guarantee the actual availability, suitability, or reliability of this internet access for any purpose, including volume. The operator is entitled to admit additional users at any time and to restrict, partially or temporarily, the user's access or exclude them from further usage entirely. The operator reserves the right, in particular, to block access to specific websites or services via the WLAN at their reasonable discretion and at any time.

# 2. Limitation of Liability

The user is aware that the WLAN only provides access to the internet. The operator does not provide any additional security measures (e.g., virus protection, firewall, etc.). The data traffic established using the WLAN is not encrypted due to the use of a password-less WLAN. The operator does not review the accessed content. The use of the WLAN is at the user's own risk. The operator is not liable for damages to the user's devices or data resulting from the use of the WLAN, unless such damages are intentionally or grossly negligently caused by the operator and/or their agents.

# 3. User's Responsibility

The user is solely responsible for the data transmitted via the WLAN, the services utilized, and the legal transactions conducted. If the user uses third-party services via the WLAN, they are responsible for any resulting costs. The user specifically agrees to comply with applicable laws when using the WLAN. In particular, the user shall:

- not unlawfully reproduce, distribute, or make copyrighted works publicly available, especially in connection with uploading and downloading via file-sharing programs or similar offerings;
- not use the WLAN to access or distribute morally or legally objectionable content;
- comply with applicable youth protection regulations;
- not send or distribute degrading, defamatory, or threatening content;
- not use the WLAN for sending spam and/or other forms of unauthorized advertising.

# 4. Indemnification of the Operator from Third-Party Claims

The user indemnifies the operator from any damages and third-party claims resulting from the user's unlawful use of the WLAN and/or a violation of the present agreement. This indemnification also extends to the costs and expenses associated with the assertion or defense of such claims.

# 5. Documentation

The user has been informed that every use of the operator's WLAN is documented and archived with the IP address, MAC address, date, and duration to protect the operator if necessary and to prove which user used the WLAN and when.
